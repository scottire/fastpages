    "I had been meaning to learn more about AI. I'd watch amazing products being released which boasted that they were \"*powered by AI*\", but I knew very little about it... other than that it was going to be cause of our species' downfall, of course. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was a Software Developer for 3 years and now I'm a [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) clone, with a herd of autonomous bots at my fingertips. In reality, I'm building machine learning based applications for a company called [Speech Graphics](https://www.speech-graphics.com/) in Edinburgh. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you take one thing from this post, it's that **developing the confidence to take steps towards working with and understanding machine learning was the most important part of my experience**. At first I  thought that it was reserved for PhD graduates and a someone like me would need to wait until we can upload knowledge with a human-brain interface before I could understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "My way of building confidence was through doing online courses. I was very privileged that the company I worked for at the time, an amazing NFC startup called [Flomio](https://flomio.com/), were willing to let me bill hours watching an online course on machine learning. I followed [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)'s \"Practical Deep Learning for Coders\" and then watched CS231n in my spare time. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, although there was a fairly long road ahead, it was night and day. I had the *confidence* that the jelly in my skull didn't need any additional compute power to grasp it."

    "If you already know how to code, you can be up and running training models in a day after watching the first lecture of [fast.ai](http://fast.ai). Fast.ai's \"top down approach\" really helps motivate continued learning by showing you what's possible. Having a software developer background really made things easier, you can gradually dive deeper into the different concepts, as you would with a new library or API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use a language and a library at the same time can be a pain... first learn the language, then learn the libraries/APIs that are written with it. In my experience, this is true for machine learning too... once I had learned python, picking up `fastai` and `PyTorch` was much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I had a reasonable grasp of `fastai` and `PyTorch`, I looked around for university courses that might help me transition into a machine learning. Although it would’ve been nice to make the transition completely independently outside of institutions, I felt I would benefit from the structure of it and having the degree would also help my job search. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This is by no means a \"you need a degree\" statement**, the most valuable lessons I've learned has been from self-guided study online. Taking the risk financially was the hardest consideration for me. My only advice for this is to try and save as much as you can, and look for funding / scholarships where available."

    "So I in enrolled in Artificial Intelligence with Speech and Multimodal Interaction MSc in Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland. The course focused on big data applications, intro to data science, statistics, and one fancy module called Biologically Inspired Computation (see my previous two blog posts about [Genetic Algorithm](https://www.scottcondron.com/jupyter/optimisation/visualisation/2020/07/20/interactive-genetic-algorithm-dashboard-from-scratch-in-python.html) and [Particle Swarm Optimisation](https://www.scottcondron.com/jupyter/optimisation/visualisation/2020/08/02/interactive-particle-swarm-optimisation-from-scratch-in-python.html) for examples of that). \n",

    "You may notice that there wasn't a large amount of Deep Learning there. Although the fundamentals of neural networks were thought and we had to build a neural net from scratch, the online courses I did were a lot more practically useful than what I learned in university, especially fast.ai. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having had experience programming professionally and having learned many fundamentals from the different online courses, my university experience went a lot smoother than my undergraduate degree. There was lots of late nights and pretty much every weekend was spent doing assignments during the day, but honestly, I enjoyed the sense of purpose that pursuing the degree gave me. "

This was in the relatively small city of Edinburgh so I imagine opportunities are even greater in bigger cities.  \n",

The whole process was one and a half years from start to finish. I made the decision to join Speech Graphics because machine learning is core to their product and they have a dedicated ML team so I knew I would be in a good position to learn a lot.\n",
