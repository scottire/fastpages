# Who I am

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from Dublin, Ireland üáÆüá™Û†Å¥Û†Åø. 

# Why I built this website

The main reason for building this blog was to have an outlet for sharing things I learn or build. I'm hoping people will enjoy the blog so much that they'll reach out and I'll build relationships with like-minded people.

# What am I up to

I'm currently interested in Machine Learning, MLOps and Data Visualisation.

I was working as a web/mobile Software Developer for a few years and then went back to University to do an MSc in AI in Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. Following that, I worked for 2 years as a Research Engineer at [Speech Graphics](https://www.speech-graphics.com/).

I'm now working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). I also write blog posts within my work at W&B, you can see those here: [My W&B Profile](https://wandb.ai/_scott).

You can [follow me on Twitter here](https://www.twitter.com/_scottcondron).
