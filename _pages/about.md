# Who I am

I'm a Research Engineer focused on Deep Learning with Audio. I'm from Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪 and living in Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. I'm from a family of small business owners. 

# Why I built this website

The main reason for building this blog was to have an outlet for sharing things I learn or build. I'm hoping people will enjoy the blog so much that they'll reach out and I'll build relationships with like-minded people.

# What am I up to

I'm currently interested in Deep Learning, Python software development and Data Visualisation... along with bits and bobs from lots of other areas.

I was working as a web/mobile Software Developer for a few years and then went back to University to do an MSc in AI in Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. I then worked for 2 years as a Research Engineer at [Speech Graphics](https://www.speech-graphics.com/).

I'm now working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).
